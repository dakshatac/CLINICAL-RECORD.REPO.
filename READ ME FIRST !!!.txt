         C programming is one of the most popular programming languages of all time and is currently 
in use for projects ranging from mobile apps to computer operating systems .C programming allows for more 
complexity than other programs and flexibility in how the data may be stored. Programs written in this 
language often store data about a patient. Patient records are a critical part of maintaining the health
 of individuals in society. However, they can also be a tedious and time-consuming task. The use of C programming
 allows us to record patient information and store it in an organized manner .The first step in patient
 record management is to create a database for the incoming records. In this database, the data about
 the patient (name, age, disease , phone number) should be logged as well as their current health care data. 
This data could be anything from blood pressure to past medical history to prescriptions. There are many 
benefits to using digitalized records, including the fact that they are easy to use and maintain. Additionally,
 digitalized records can be accessed by anyone with a computer, making them more convenient than traditional paper records.
 Finally, digitalized records are more secure than paper records, as they cannot be lost or stolen.
